# What is a Component Library?

A component library is a collection of cohesively designed, individually created blocks of code, which are then used to created complex pages and applications.

Creating a component library gives developers access to reliable, tested and repeatable code, which eliminates code duplication, encourages documentation and speeds up application development.
