# What is a Component Library?

A component library is a collection of cohesively designed, individually created blocks of code, which are then used to created complex pages and applications.

Creating a component library gives developers access to reliable, tested and repeatable code, which eliminates code duplication, encourages documentation and speeds up application development. A component library also enables designers to easily explore the existing library to ensure each component matches their designs.

This demo library showcases all of the above, as well as snippets of code for each of the included components, and documentation for their functionality.
